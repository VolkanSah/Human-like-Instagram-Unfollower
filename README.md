## Best instagram Unfollower Debian/Ubuntu
If you knowlege about marketing, than you do need only an unfollower !
This script settet up to look like a human, let it work in  a cron
important sources for me: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html

### Install the required Python packages with the following command:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7
    pip install -U selenium webdriver_manager

    
## Usage
Replace the username and password variables in the script with your Instagram account credentials.
Adjust the number of scroll operations in the script depending on the number of followers you want to load.
Run the script with the following command:

      python unfollow.py
      
      Be carefuly you can be blocked, i test my configuration, after 25 unfollows you can get warning, if to often, then you get banned.
      best is 15 and you can use it in cron with 10 , 15 or 30 Minutes to work effektively
